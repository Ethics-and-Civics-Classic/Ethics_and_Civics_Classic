# modifier = { } only takes the following modifiers
# hull, shield & armor add/mult and regen add perc/static
# evasion add/mult
# speed/base speed mult
# weapon damage mult
# upkeep mult

# use_shipnames_from = other_size # allows a ship size to use names from another size
# icon = ship_size_military_1
		#ship_size_military_1 is default. The following sprite keys are generated from it:
			#GFX_text_<key>
			#GFX_<key>
			#GFX_<key>_top
			#GFX_<key>_top_damaged
# icon_frame: now only used for starbases. Value of 2 or more means it shows up on the galaxy map, 1-5 denote which icon it uses on starbase sprite sheets (e.g. gfx/interface/icons/starbase_ship_sizes.dds)
