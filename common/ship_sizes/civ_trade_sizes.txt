# modifier = { } only takes the following modifiers
# hull, shield & armor add/mult and regen add perc/static
# Evasion add/mult
# speed/base speed mult
# Weapon damage mult
# Upkeep mult
# For other modifiers, use ship_modifier = { }
# use_shipnames_from = other_size # Allows a ship size to use names from another size
# icon = ship_size_military_1
		# ship_size_military_1 is default. The following sprite keys are generated from it:
			# GFX_text_<key>
			# GFX_<key>
			# GFX_<key>_top
			# GFX_<key>_top_damaged
# icon_frame: now only used for starbases. Value of 2 or more means it shows up on the galaxy map, 1-5 denote which icon it uses on starbase sprite sheets (e.g. gfx/interface/icons/starbase_ship_sizes.dds)
# ai_ship_data = {					# For determining how many ships the AI wants. Ships it can't recruit (i.e. Missing tech prereqs or fails potential_country or possible_country) are pre-filtered out.
# 	fraction = { }					# As standard, base, modifier = { factor }, etc. The AI will want this divided by the total fraction it is able to recruit. Note: it is the fraction of the naval cap, so the final value is divided by size_multiplier
#									# Note: if the fraction is > 0, the following lines will not be applied
#	min = 1							# Sets a minimum absolute number the country will aim to have
#	system_mult/planet_mult = 0.1	# Adds this amount for each system/planet the country owns. I.e. Min + ( num planets * planet_mult ) + ( num systems * system_mult )
#	max = 5							# Sets a maximum absolute number the country will aim to have. Note that it will still want only the minimum unless you define a system_mult or planet_mult
