# Their purpose is to categorize the list of ship graphics cultures in the ship set browser within the empire editor.
# Trigger 'potential' (this = country)  defines if a gfx culture belongs to a ship set. 
# Because gfx culture is not an object of the game state a country with the corresponding gfx culture is used in the event scope.
