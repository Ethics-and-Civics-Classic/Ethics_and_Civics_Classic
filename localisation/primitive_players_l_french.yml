 # buildings
 building_primitive_power_plant:0 "Primitive Power Plant"
 building_primitive_power_plant_desc:1 "Power plants of this type generate either toxic pollutants or dangerously radioactive wastes."
 
 # Drive components
 EXPERIMENTAL_DRIVE:0 "Experimental Hyper Drive"
 EXPERIMENTAL_DRIVE_DESC:0 "We can now travel along the hyperlane network, albeit very slowly compared to what our models predict. We cannot guarantee we can do so safely or reliably. The drive is...unpredictable. It may need to be shut down and remotely restarted during hyperspace travel. This could have many side effects, some of which might even be positive.\n\n"
 
 # Warp Drives
 tech_hyper_drive_1:0 "Hyperspace Theory"
 tech_hyper_drive_1_desc:0 "Like the strands of a spider web, the extra-dimensional realm of hyperspace runs between the gravity wells of most stars. Faster than light travel is theoretically possible along these hyperlanes.\n\n"
 tech_experimental_hyper_drive:0 "Experimental Hyperspace Drives"
 tech_experimental_hyper_drive_desc:0 ""Hyperspace theory has proven sound, but we still need to devise a way to cross the dimensional boundary and navigate the hyperlanes.\n\n""
 tech_hyper_drive_15:0 "Practical Hyperspace Travel"
 tech_hyper_drive_15_desc:0 "Test data gathered from experimental drives has vastly improved our understanding of hyperspace, and we should now be able to devise much faster, safer, and more reliable drive technology suitable for widespread use.\n\n"
 
 #Map Modes
 plentiful_mapmodes_ftl_map_mode:0 "FTL Map Mode"
 plentiful_mapmodes_ftl_map_mode_desc:0 "Colors empire borders by their §YFTL technology§!."
