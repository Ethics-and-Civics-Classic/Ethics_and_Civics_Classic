 # buildings
 building_primitive_power_plant:0 "Primitive Power Plant"
 building_primitive_power_plant_desc:1 "Power plants of this type generate either toxic pollutants or dangerously radioactive wastes."
 building_fallout_shelter:0 "Underground Fallout Shelter"
 building_fallout_shelter_desc:0 "Ruins of minor buildings disguise the surface entrance to a massive underground vault, serving as a bomb shelter and storehouse of technology for this world's elite inhabitants."
 
 # Drive components
 EXPERIMENTAL_DRIVE:0 "Experimental Hyper Drive"
 EXPERIMENTAL_DRIVE_DESC:0 "We can now travel along the hyperlane network, albeit very slowly compared to what our models predict. We cannot guarantee we can do so safely or reliably. The drive is...unpredictable. It may need to be shut down and remotely restarted during hyperspace travel. This could have many side effects, some of which might even be positive.\n\n"
 
 # Warp Drives
 tech_hyper_drive_1:0 "Hyperspace Theory"
 tech_hyper_drive_1_desc:0 "Like the strands of a spider web, the extra-dimensional realm of hyperspace runs between the gravity wells of most stars. Faster than light travel is theoretically possible along these hyperlanes.\n\n"
 tech_experimental_hyper_drive:0 "Experimental Hyperspace Drives"
 tech_experimental_hyper_drive_desc:0 ""Hyperspace theory has proven sound, but we still need to devise a way to cross the dimensional boundary and navigate the hyperlanes.\n\n""
 tech_hyper_drive_15:0 "Practical Hyperspace Travel"
 tech_hyper_drive_15_desc:0 "Test data gathered from experimental drives has vastly improved our understanding of hyperspace, and we should now be able to devise much faster, safer, and more reliable drive technology suitable for widespread use.\n\n"
 
 #Map Modes
 plentiful_mapmodes_ftl_map_mode:0 "FTL Map Mode"
 plentiful_mapmodes_ftl_map_mode_desc:0 "Colors empire borders by their §YFTL technology§!."
 HAS_HYPER_DRIVE_1:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has the first level of §YHyper Drive§! technology."
 HAS_HYPER_DRIVE_2:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has the second level of §YHyper Drive§! technology."
 HAS_HYPER_DRIVE_3:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has the third level of §YHyper Drive§! technology."
 HAS_JUMP_DRIVE:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has the §YJump Drive§! technology."
 HAS_PSI_DRIVE:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has the §YPsi Drive§! technology."
 HAS_NO_DRIVE:0 "§Y[This.GetName]§! has no FTL technology."
 
 #Tile Blockers
 tb_enemy:0 "£blocker  Hostile Nation"
 tb_enemy_desc:0 "This region is home to a portion of our species whose fundamental values are so profoundly different from ours that it may be that we have more in common with aliens."
 tb_2nd_enemy:0 "£blocker  Hostile Organic Species"
 tb_2nd_enemy_desc:0 "This region is under the control of organic life unlike us."

 machine_primitive:1 "Refitted Workbot Army"
 machine_primitive_plural:1 "Refitted Workbot Armies"
 machine_primitive_desc:1 "Industrial machines repurposed and modified for war. They pursue their objectives relentlessly, and are impervious to the shattering effects of poor morale that so often plague organic combat units."
 
 # Government Age Stages
 PrimPlayer_gov_pre_industrial_age:0 "Pre-Industrial Age"
 PrimPlayer_gov_pre_industrial_age_desc:0 "This civilization resides in a pre-industrial era, it will be a long while until they reach into the stars."
 PrimPlayer_gov_industrial_age:0 "Industrial Age"
 PrimPlayer_gov_industrial_age_desc:0 "This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of an early Industrial Age. Electricity and internal combustion engines are gradually coming into widespread use, while urbanization increases at a rapid pace."
 PrimPlayer_gov_machine_age:0 "Machine Age"
 PrimPlayer_gov_machine_age_desc:0 "This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of a Machine Age, considered a later part of the Industrial Age. Their factories are mass-producing goods and vehicles, and air travel is becoming commonplace."
 PrimPlayer_gov_atomic_age:0 "Atomic Age"
 PrimPlayer_gov_atomic_age_desc:0 "This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of an Atomic Age. They have harnessed the power of the atom, but not yet made it into space. Nuclear weapons may be prolific, and could result in a sudden extinction event."
 PrimPlayer_gov_early_space_age:0 "Early Space Age"
 PrimPlayer_gov_early_space_age_desc:0 "This civilization has entered an Early Space Age. Primitive satellites are orbiting their homeworld, and the first manned space missions have been concluded in low orbit. They will soon be ready to leave their world."
